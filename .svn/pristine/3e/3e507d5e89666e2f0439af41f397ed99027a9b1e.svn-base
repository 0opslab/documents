# reset



Resets DiskShadow.exe to the default state. **Reset** is especially useful in separating compound DiskShadow operations such as **create**, **import**, **backup**, or **restore**.

## Syntax

```
reset
```

## Remarks

-   When you use the **reset** command, you lose state from commands such as **add**, **set**, **load**, or **writer**. **Reset** also releases IVssBackupComponent interfaces and loses non-persistent shadow copies.
